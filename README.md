# ðŸŽ“ College AI Event Tracker

## Project Overview

The **AI Event Tracker** is a simple, robust web application built with Python and Flask to manage and display college events like workshops, seminars, and hackathons. It provides both a user-friendly view of upcoming events and a set of administrative tools for quick data management (Add, Search, Filter).

All event data is persisted locally in a structured JSON file (`events_college.json`), making the application easy to run and maintain without an external database.
